            <h2>Key Features:</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scheduling Precision:</strong> The calendar feature
                    allows users to schedule events with precision, ensuring
                    that all activities are well-planned and coordinated. This
                    is vital for avoiding scheduling conflicts and optimizing
                    the use of time and resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Visibility and Overview:</strong> Having a calendar
                    provides a visual representation of all scheduled events,
                    deadlines, and milestones. This visibility allows planners
                    to have an overview of their timeline, making it easier to
                    manage and allocate resources effectively.</li>
                <li><strong>Coordination and Collaboration:</strong> A calendar
                    feature facilitates collaboration among team members and
                    stakeholders. Everyone involved in the event can access and
                    contribute to the calendar, promoting seamless communication
                    and coordination.</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Optimization:</strong> By having a clear
                    calendar view, event planners can optimize resources
                    efficiently. This includes managing staff schedules, venue
                    availability, and equipment rentals, ensuring that
                    everything aligns with the event timeline. ></li>
